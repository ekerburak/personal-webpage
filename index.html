            Hi, I'm Burak Eker.
            I'm out here exploring things.
            This is my personal webpage and first ever sort of serious HTML project.
            This website certainly needs some flavor and I'll work on it once I learn a relatable amount of CSS.
        </p>

        <h2>Music Taste</h2>
        <p>
            Actually I have no strong bias to any musical genre, however, I often find myself listening to pop songs.
            Also, I do unironically listen to some phonk (it is so very energy-pumping!).
            Another genre I enjoy listening to is electronic house. I find it particularly beneficial when I need to concentrate on tasks without getting distracted by outer factors. It is because its repetitive (and oftentimes instrumental) nature allows me to treat it as a background music.
